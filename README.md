## About Me

Experienced tech enthusiast currently pursuing studies at Brawijaya University with a robust grasp of programming languages like Python, C, PHP, Java, HTML, and CSS, complemented by entry-level proficiency in Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and Data Science. Possessing an intermediate skill level in frameworks including Laravel, Bootstrap, Ruby on Rails, and Flask, I thrive in collaborative environments, actively contributing as a dedicated team player. My commitment to effective communication and unwavering work ethics cultivates a harmonious and productive work culture. As someone motivated and adaptable, I offer a strong programming foundation and a burgeoning interest in cutting-edge technologies such as Machine Learning and Data Science, making me an exciting prospect for those seeking a dynamic addition to their team.

## Projects

### Project 1: Chatbot Application

Description: A natural language processing-powered chatbot that leverages the OpenAI API for generating responses. This project demonstrates my expertise in integrating AI-powered conversation capabilities. I explored the `text-davinci-003` model and also experimented with the LLM `qwen-7B`, although it's a work in progress due to lacking specifications to fully utilize the transformers.

Custom Chatbot:
I'm also developing a custom chatbot using TensorFlow and several key libraries, including tokenization, LSTM, and attention mechanisms. This project showcases my proficiency in building AI-powered conversational agents from scratch.

### Project 2: Sales Forecasting System

Description: An advanced sales forecasting system that utilizes various technologies and methodologies. The system is designed to handle large datasets, implement predictive models, and generate valuable insights to inform business decisions.

### Project 3: Churn Prediction

Description: In this project, I implemented churn prediction using machine learning techniques. I initially used a Random Forest classifier and achieved an accuracy of approximately 78.63%. I then experimented with XGBoost, achieving an improved accuracy of around 84.31%. The project showcases my skills in data preprocessing, feature selection, and machine learning model evaluation.

### Project 4: Sentiment Analysis

Description: This project involved sentiment analysis using the IMDb dataset. I employed the scikit-learn library to build a sentiment classifier. The model achieved a validation accuracy of 87%. The project demonstrates my ability to preprocess text data, create machine learning pipelines, and evaluate model performance.

### Project 5: Toxicity Classification

Description: I developed a toxicity classification model using TensorFlow and LSTM networks. The model predicts multiple toxicity-related labels based on text input. The dataset was preprocessed, tokenized, and split into training and validation sets. The trained model achieved accuracy on the test set. This project showcases my proficiency in working with sequential data and multi-label classification tasks.
